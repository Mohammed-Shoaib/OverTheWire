# Level 24 → Level 25

## Level Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

## Solution

Login in to banditx with the password retrieved from [Level x](../Level%20x%20→%20Level%20y/).

```
ssh banditx@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Head over to [Level y](../Level%20y%20→%20Level%20z/).
