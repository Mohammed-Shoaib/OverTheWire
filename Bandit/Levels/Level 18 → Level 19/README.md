# Level 18 → Level 19

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

### Commands you may need to solve this level

ssh, ls, cat

## Solution

Login in to banditx with the password retrieved from [Level x](../Level%20x%20→%20Level%20y/).

```
ssh banditx@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Head over to [Level y](../Level%20y%20→%20Level%20z/).
